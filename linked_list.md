# Singly Linked List
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.**
**Define a method called insert which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
**Define a method called includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Node’s value somewhere within the list.
**Define a method called print which takes in no arguments and outputs all of the current Node values in the Linked List.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
The most challenging part of knowing what to add to the ListNode class and what to add to the SinglyLinkedList class.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Drawing a picture of what i wanted to happen was the best approach for this. The Big O was O(n)
