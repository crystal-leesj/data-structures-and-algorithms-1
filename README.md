# Reverse an Array
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
The problem domain was basically to reverse an array
## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Creating a new array

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Drew a picture to realize what the final answer for any given array should look like

## Solution

# Insert and shift middle index of array
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Taking an existing array and insert an element to the middle of the array.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
It was a challenge to come up with the right condition so that you don't  lose an elements but shift them

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I ended up drawing a picture for to then to create a new array with a length of the old array plus one

## Solution

# Binary Search
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
This function called binary search takes in tow parameters, a sorted array and search
key. It returns the index of the array element that equals to the search key or minus
one of it does not exist.


## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Writing the tests and making sure that they make sense.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
The approach was to first conceptualize what the solution should/would look like. The big O
was O(log sub n). The code was effiect in the sense that it readjusted for the array length
depending on what the mid point was compared to the key.
